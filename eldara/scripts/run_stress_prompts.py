"""Run the GM stress prompts through fresh Claude Code sessions and export
one file holding every input and its output.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
adversarial_stress_test.py has two ways to get a GM response for its
GM_STRESS_PROMPTS: --auto-gm, which calls the Messages API and therefore
tests a model with no tools and no file access, and
--submit-stress-prompt, which tests the real thing but needs a person to
paste five prompts by hand and save what comes back.

This is the third way, and it is the one that actually answers the
question the other two can't. Each prompt goes to its own `claude -p`
invocation: a fresh non-interactive Claude Code session, with real file
access to the campaign, that has never seen the conversation in which
these instructions were written or these cases chosen. That last part is
the whole point. Anyone who helped design a check is the worst person to
measure it, because they know what it is looking for.

WHAT IT DOES NOT SEND
---------------------
Each case in GM_STRESS_PROMPTS carries a `watch_for` note describing the
failure mode it probes. That note is written into the exported transcript
for whoever reads it, and is NEVER sent to the session under test.
Telling the subject what is being measured would defeat the measurement.

CONTAINMENT
-----------
A session reached this way has tools, so a prompt ending "draft the
resulting state" may well try to commit one. Every run therefore happens
against a throwaway copy of the project, made fresh per run, and the live
campaign is never the working directory. Anything a session commits lands
in the copy and is reported, not hidden. The copy has no git remote, so
nothing can be pushed from it.

The exported transcript is the deliverable: prompts, responses, timings,
exit codes, and provenance, in one file a human can read end to end.

USAGE
-----
    python3 scripts/run_stress_prompts.py
        Run all cases at the default model, write the transcript to
        saves/exports/.

    python3 scripts/run_stress_prompts.py --case pressure-to-invent-gear
        One case only.

    python3 scripts/run_stress_prompts.py --label opus5-high --effort high
        Tag the run and set the effort level, so two runs can be compared.

    python3 scripts/run_stress_prompts.py --dry-run
        Print what would be sent, and to what, without spending anything.

Each case is a real model call against a real campaign copy. Five cases
is five calls; --effort high or above makes each one slower and dearer.
