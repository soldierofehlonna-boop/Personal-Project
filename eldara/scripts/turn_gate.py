"""Rejects a turn's output if it writes the STATE_CHANGE:committed marker
without a real commit having actually happened FOR THIS TURN. Useful as
a manual check, or wired into an agentic coding tool's test command if
you're running one.

This checks two things:
  1. If the latest assistant output (passed on stdin, or read from a
     given path) contains the marker, the token embedded in the marker
     (e.g. "<!-- STATE_CHANGE:committed:47-a3f9c2 -->") must exactly
     match the "commit_token" field currently in saves/current.json.
  2. If it doesn't contain the marker, no check is needed -- turns that
     don't change state are allowed to skip the marker entirely.

The token is generated fresh by scripts/commit_state.py on every commit
and printed to stdout, so the marker can only match if the GM actually
ran the commit for this turn and copied its real output. See
docs/RECOVERY.md for further discussion.

Remaining limitation this does NOT close: a model could still fabricate
a plausible-looking token in its reply without ever having run the
commit script or seen real output. This script can only catch that if
the fabricated token happens not to match what's actually in
saves/current.json -- which it won't, since the token space is large
and the model has no way to predict it. But if a model chooses to
transcribe the exact token another way (e.g. it was leaked earlier in
context), this check alone can't prove the commit truly happened *this
turn* rather than being copied from an earlier turn's real output. This
is the honest-narrator problem, not the timing-vs-causation problem the
original design set out to fix -- see docs/RECOVERY.md.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/turn_gate.py <path-to-turn-output>
    (or pipe the turn's text on stdin with no argument)
