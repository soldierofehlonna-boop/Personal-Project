"""Get playtest_audit.py to a genuinely clean, fully-covered report --
by actually playing real turns through the real commit pipeline, not by
faking the numbers.

WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT DO
-------------------------------
Pass 2 of playtest_audit.py (the adversarial regression suite) tests the
TOOLING in an isolated sandbox and needs no campaign history -- if it's
failing, that's a real code bug, and this script deliberately does NOT
touch it. Faking a "PASS" there would hide an actual defect.

Pass 1 (coverage) and Pass 3 (drift proxies) read real campaign state
(saves/current.json, saves/journal.md). The only honest way to make
Pass 1 show full coverage is for those 11 mechanisms to have actually
fired at least once. This script does exactly that: it drafts 11 small,
schema-valid turns -- each one deliberately designed to trip exactly one
previously-missed Pass 1 mechanism -- and commits each one through the
REAL scripts/commit_state.py pipeline (real validate_state.py check,
real self_critique.py gate against real drafted narration text, real
git commit). Nothing here writes to saves/current.json directly or
bypasses validation; every turn either passes commit_state.py for real
or this script stops and reports exactly why.

This only makes sense to run against a throwaway/test campaign, since it
permanently advances turn count and campaign history. Refuses to run
against a campaign already past turn 0, to avoid clobbering real play.

Usage (either form works identically -- session.py just wraps this file):
    python3 scripts/session.py earn-coverage             # play the 11 turns, then audit
    python3 scripts/session.py earn-coverage --dry-run   # show the plan, commit nothing
    python3 scripts/session.py earn-coverage --audit-only
                                                          # skip playing turns, just run
                                                          # the real audit as-is

    python3 scripts/earn_clean_slate.py             # equivalent direct form
    python3 scripts/earn_clean_slate.py --dry-run
    python3 scripts/earn_clean_slate.py --audit-only
