"""Validate a proposed state file and, if it passes, replace
saves/current.json with it -- then append a journal entry, update the
NPC registry, and (if this is a git repo) commit the save files together,
pushing to a remote automatically if one is configured.

Two modes:
    python3 scripts/commit_state.py /tmp/proposed_state.json
        Validates the proposed file against the CURRENT saves/current.json
        (for turn/date continuity) and the schema, then promotes it.

    python3 scripts/commit_state.py
        No proposed file given -- assumes saves/current.json has already
        been directly edited (e.g. restoring a hand-edited save per
        docs/RECOVERY.md). Backs it up, validates what's already there,
        then runs the same journal + git-commit step.

Self-critique is mandatory whenever a proposed state file is given (i.e.
a real turn is being committed, not just a re-validation of an existing
save) -- some form of this turn's drafted narration must be supplied so
self_critique.py can run against it before the commit proceeds. Provide
exactly one of:

    --critique-file /path/to.txt   Path to a file on this machine holding
                                    the turn's drafted narration text.
    --critique-text "..."          The narration text given directly as
                                    an argument -- no separate file
                                    needed for short turns.
    --critique-stdin               Read the narration text from stdin,
                                    e.g. piped from a shell in the same
                                    session: `python3 scripts/commit_state.py
                                    turn.json --critique-stdin < turn.txt`.

If self_critique.py flags anything, the commit is refused and
saves/current.json is left untouched. To bypass this gate for a specific
commit (e.g. a confirmed false positive, or a turn with no real prose to
check), pass --skip-critique explicitly -- this is intentionally a
separate, visible opt-out rather than the default, so skipping the check
is always a deliberate choice logged in your own shell history, not
something that happens by omission.

Whenever self_critique.py runs (and passes), scripts/lore_consistency_check.py
also runs against the same narration -- an ADVISORY-ONLY pass that
retrieves relevant lore from docs/ELDARA_REFERENCE.md and
docs/CHAD_BACKSTORY.md (via world_info_lookup.py) and surfaces it, plus a
small set of pinned-fact contradiction checks, for a human to read. It
never affects the commit's success or failure -- there is no
"lore-critique failed" outcome, only output worth glancing at. Pass
--skip-lore-check to omit even printing that output for this commit (the
gate itself was never blocking; this only silences the advisory print).

When no proposed file is given (re-validating an already-edited
saves/current.json, e.g. during docs/RECOVERY.md), no new narration
exists for this call, so the critique gate does not apply and none of
the --critique-* flags are required.

Optional flags (either mode):
    --note "..."                  One-line note appended to the journal.

    Why this exists: npc_registry.json previously only ever recorded
    {"name": ...} at the moment an npc_id was first introduced (see

    project's answer to Auferet's Character Library actually
    remembering someone, not just deduplicating an id -- see
    prune_advisor.py's docstring, which already ranks prune candidates
    by this same last_referenced_turn field.

    Only ever adds/refreshes detail, never removes a name the registry

    entry once update_npc_registry() has run.

    Real bug this fixes: is_new_npc is only meaningful at the moment a
    proposed state is being validated against npc_registry.json (true =
    "this id isn't registered yet", false = "it already is"). But the
    unmodified flow left that same true/false value sitting in
    saves/current.json permanently. update_npc_registry() runs and
    registers the id BEFORE the pre-commit git hook re-validates that
    same file -- so a turn that introduces even one new NPC would pass
    run_validation() at proposal time (is_new_npc=true, id not yet
    registered), get written to saves/current.json and registered, and
    then fail the git commit itself when the hook re-checked the exact
    same now-persisted is_new_npc=true against the now-updated registry.
    The result: saves/current.json silently drifted ahead of git history
    with no error surfaced to the caller (git_commit_if_repo() only
    returned a bool; commit_state.py's own stdout reported the generic
    "not a git repository, or nothing to commit" message either way).
    Confirmed end-to-end in testing, not a hypothetical: reproduced with
    a real new NPC introduction, a real git repo, and the real installed
    pre-commit hook.

    Once an id is registered, it no longer needs an explicit is_new_npc
    value at all for this or any later commit -- validate_state.py's
    registry check only requires the field on a genuinely new
    introduction. Clearing it here removes the stale claim rather than
    leaving a value that becomes wrong the instant registration happens."""

    journey as complete -- set current_location to the destination and
    clear travel -- rather than requiring the GM to remember to do both
    by hand on the exact right turn.

    Why this exists: current_location/travel (added for the World Map
    feature) only get validated for internal consistency by
    validate_state.py -- nothing enforced that arrival actually happened
    when the calendar said it should. A GM narrating "you arrive" while
    forgetting to clear the now-stale travel object (or update
    current_location) would pass validation cleanly, since travel with a
    past ETA isn't itself an error, just a state that should have already
    resolved. This closes that gap the same way update_npc_registry()
    closes the "new NPC introduced but registry not updated" gap: by
    making the mechanical follow-through automatic instead of relying on
    the GM to remember it turn after turn.

    Deliberately conservative: only acts when eta_date is present and
    parses (via date_ordinal), and only when the new state's own
    in_world_date is AT OR PAST that ETA -- an in-progress journey with a
    future ETA is left untouched, since the GM may still be narrating
    travel-stage scenes and hasn't arrived yet. If eta_date is missing or
    unparseable, this silently does nothing rather than guessing; the
    existing validate_state.py warnings already cover surfacing that
    problem to a human.

    Mutates state in place and returns True if an arrival was resolved,

    this is additive and never breaks validation for older saves that
    predate it.

    Why this exists: prune_advisor.py's existing heuristic ranks a "safe
    to prune" NPC purely by how much text is already in their entry
    (note/disposition length) -- its own docstring already documents the
    resulting flaw, that a narratively important but thinly-detailed NPC

    real, checkable signal instead of an absence entirely.

    Deliberately narrow, matching this project's existing self_critique.py
    pattern-matching conventions rather than attempting semantic
    detection: a whole-word, case-insensitive match on the NPC's current
    'name' field. Known gap, same shape as self_critique.py's own
