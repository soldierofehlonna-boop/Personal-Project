"""Bundle this campaign's save data into a single JSON file for archiving
or handing to another person -- the "download your adventure" analog.

Why this exists: saves/current.json, saves/journal.md, saves/locations.json
and saves/npc_registry.json already ARE the save, spread across separate
files plus git history. That's the right shape for this project to run
(git is the actual survivability mechanism -- see LOCAL.md), but it's not
a shape a person can casually hand to someone else the way Auferet's
"download as a file" export works: doing that today means finding and
sending four separate files (or a git bundle) and hoping none of them are
skipped or out of sync with each other. This script produces exactly one
file that captures a specific, self-consistent moment.

Deliberately excludes saves/player_notes.md by default: that file is
explicitly out-of-character player preferences, never narrated and never
canon (see saves/player_notes.md's own header and prompts/GM_INSTRUCTIONS.md),
so an export meant to be archived or shared with someone else should not
silently carry it along. Pass --include-player-notes if you specifically
want it (e.g. exporting only for your own backup, not to share).

This is read-only with respect to the save files themselves -- it never
modifies saves/current.json, journal.md, locations.json, or
npc_registry.json, only reads them into one output file. It has no
opinion on WHERE the campaign is narratively; it exports whatever is
currently committed, matching status_dump.py's "answer from the actual
file" principle rather than reconstructing anything from conversation
memory.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/export_save.py [output_path]
        Writes the bundle to output_path (default: saves/exports/<turn>-<UTC timestamp>.json).

    python3 scripts/export_save.py --include-player-notes [output_path]
        Also includes saves/player_notes.md's raw text in the bundle.
