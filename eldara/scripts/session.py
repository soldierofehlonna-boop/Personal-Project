"""Single entry point for running The Eldara Project's mechanical side.
Designed around this project's actual deployment target: a Claude Code
session (Claude PC directly, or Claude iOS via Remote Control or a Cloud
Session -- see LOCAL.md) that has direct filesystem, shell, and git
access to this repository, in the same conversation where narration
happens. Neither a Remote Control session's host computer nor a Cloud
Session's runtime is guaranteed to run unattended forever, so nothing in
this script assumes background execution; the actual narration and the
mechanical commands below happen in the same session, but this script
still can't decide what happens in the story -- see docs/OPERATING.md for
why that boundary is real, not a gap in this script.

Subcommands:
    python3 scripts/session.py setup     One-time setup for a freshly
                                          cloned repo: installs Python
                                          dependencies from requirements.txt
                                          and the git pre-commit/pre-push
                                          hooks. Run this once right after
                                          cloning, before 'check'.

    python3 scripts/session.py check     Environment + repo sanity check
                                          (git, python deps, hooks, schema).
                                          Run any time to confirm the
                                          session is in a good state.

    python3 scripts/session.py start     Validates current state and prints
                                          a status summary. Safe to run
                                          any time.

    python3 scripts/session.py commit FILE [--note "..."]
            [--critique-file PATH | --critique-text "..." | --critique-stdin]
            [--skip-critique]
                                          Wraps commit_state.py: validates
                                          a proposed state file and, if
                                          it passes, promotes it, backs up
                                          the old one (pruning old backups
                                          beyond the most recent 30),
                                          updates the NPC registry,
                                          journals the diff, and commits
                                          to git if this is a repo --
                                          pushing to a remote automatically
                                          if one is configured.

                                          Whenever FILE is given (a real
                                          turn), self_critique.py MUST run
                                          clean against that turn's drafted
                                          narration before the commit is
                                          accepted -- this is mandatory,
                                          not optional. Supply the
                                          narration text one of three ways:
                                            --critique-file PATH   a file
                                              already on this machine
                                            --critique-text "..."  the
                                              text directly, inline --
                                              no separate file needed
                                            --critique-stdin       piped
                                              in on stdin
                                          Pass --skip-critique instead to
                                          deliberately bypass the gate for
                                          this one commit (confirmed false
                                          positive, or no real prose this
                                          turn). This is the one command
                                          to run after every state-changing
                                          turn.

    python3 scripts/session.py audit     Runs the full combined three-pass
                                          playtest_audit.py report.

                                          Wraps scripts/earn_clean_slate.py:

                                          pipeline (real validation, real
                                          self_critique.py gate, real git
                                          commits) -- each turn targets one
                                          specific Pass-1 coverage check that
                                          hasn't fired yet -- then runs the
                                          full audit. This earns Pass-1
                                          coverage honestly; it does not
                                          fake or hardcode any result, and
                                          it will stop and report exactly
                                          why if any turn is rejected.

                                          Refuses to run if saves/current.json
                                          is already past turn 0, to avoid
                                          overwriting real campaign history --
                                          only ever run this against a fresh
                                          or throwaway clone, never a live
                                          campaign. --dry-run shows the
                                          planned turns without committing
                                          anything; --audit-only skips
                                          playing turns and just runs the
                                          real audit as-is (equivalent to
                                          plain 'audit' above).

    python3 scripts/session.py loop      Interactive loop: repeatedly
                                          prompts for a path to a proposed
                                          state file, commits it if valid,
                                          and after every commit re-runs
                                          the audit so drift signals
                                          surface immediately rather than
                                          only when someone remembers to
                                          ask. Exits on an empty input.
