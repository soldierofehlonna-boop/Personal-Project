"""Validate saves/current.json (or an arbitrary state file) against
state_schema.json plus a handful of extra rules that plain JSON Schema
can't easily express (per-month day bounds, closed inventory at turn 0,
non-negative currency, soft-cap array sizes, npc_id registry consistency).

manual_checks() below is the authoritative enforcement layer: it runs
unconditionally, whether or not the optional jsonschema package is
installed. It covers required fields, basic types, the month enum, and
array-internal duplicate detection directly, so a missing field, a wrong
type, an invalid month name, or a colliding npc_id/gear name/thread text
is caught even without jsonschema present. This intentionally duplicates
only a bounded subset of what a full jsonschema pass would catch (see
TOP_LEVEL_TYPES below) -- it's not a JSON Schema reimplementation, just
enough hand-written coverage that this file's actual behavior matches
its documented guarantee.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/validate_state.py [path]      # authoritative check
