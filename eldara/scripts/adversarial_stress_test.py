"""Adversarial stress test for the real commit pipeline
(commit_state.py -> validate_state.py + self_critique.py -> turn_gate.py),
run under two different model/effort settings so the results are
actually comparable -- fully automated end-to-end (run, save, feed,
compare) for the tooling cases; automated for the GM-facing cases too,
but ONLY if you provide a real Anthropic API key, for reasons explained
below.

WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT DO
-------------------------------
This is earn_clean_slate.py's mirror image. That script proves the
mechanisms fire cleanly on legitimate turns; this one tries to make them
fail -- feeding cases specifically shaped to slip past validate_state.py,
self_critique.py, or turn_gate.py, or to survive contact with a GM that's
asked to draft state/narration for a deliberately awkward turn. Nothing
here is faked: every case is submitted to the REAL scripts exactly as a
live session would, and every result is recorded exactly as reported --
including a case "passing" when it should have been caught, which is a
finding, not a bug in this script.

This does NOT evaluate prose quality or pillar adherence -- it evaluates
whether the MECHANICAL gates hold up, and (in --auto-gm mode) whether a
real model call at a given effort level drafts something that gets past
them. Reading WHY a case was or wasn't caught -- is a caught case caught
for the right reason, is an uncaught one actually fine -- still needs a
human; this script reports outcomes, not verdicts.

WHY THE GM-FACING HALF NEEDS EITHER A HUMAN OR AN API KEY
-----------------------------------------------------------
Cases in TOOLING_CASES are pure data -- fixed, hand-authored JSON/text
fed straight to the scripts. These run identically regardless of model
or effort, fully automatically, because no model is involved.

Cases in GM_STRESS_PROMPTS are different: they need an actual model to
draft a response to an adversarial prompt before there's anything to
feed the pipeline. This script cannot reach into your Claude iOS /
Claude Code session and drive it -- that's a live chat interface, not
something a script elsewhere can call. There are exactly two honest ways
to run this half:

1. MANUAL (--list-stress-prompts / --submit-stress-prompt, no key needed): paste
   each prompt into your actual Claude Code session yourself at the
   setting under test, save what it drafts, feed the two files to
   --submit-stress-prompt. This is the only way to test the REAL session
   you'll actually play with (iOS app, Remote Control, whatever you use
   day to day) rather than a stand-in for it.
2. AUTOMATIC (--auto-gm, needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY): this script calls the
   real Anthropic Messages API itself, at the named model/effort pairs,
   with GM_INSTRUCTIONS.md plus the live save state as system context
   (see build_campaign_context() -- a bare API call has no tools, so the
   files a live GM reads off disk are handed to it inline), and feeds
   what comes back straight into the pipeline -- true
   run/save/feed/compare with zero manual steps. This is a genuinely
   different thing being tested, though: a bare API call at a given
   effort level with the save state pasted in, not the specific
   client (iOS app, Claude Code CLI) you actually play through, which
   may set its own defaults on top of what you request. Anthropic
   bills this key directly per token, separately from any Pro/Max
   subscription usage. docs/MODEL_NOTES.md already names this exact
   tradeoff ("own API credentials") for the self_critique.py semantic
   gap; the same tradeoff applies here for the same reason.

Neither mode is more "real" in every sense -- (1) tests your actual
client end-to-end but costs manual time per case; (2) tests the model
and effort level in isolation, automatically, but not the specific app
surface you play through. Use --auto-gm for a fast first pass across
many effort levels, then spot-check the setting you land on with a real
(1)-style manual run before trusting it for actual play.

USAGE
-----
    python3 scripts/adversarial_stress_test.py --run-all-auto \\
        --labels "opus5-medium,opus5-high" \\
        --model claude-opus-5 --efforts "medium,high"
        # Fully automatic: runs tooling cases once, runs every GM_STRESS_PROMPTS
        # prompt through the real API at each named effort level (requires
        # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY), feeds every response through the real pipeline,
        # writes one report per label, then prints a full comparison.
        # This is the "just do it end to end" entry point.

    python3 scripts/adversarial_stress_test.py --run-tooling-cases \\
        --label "opus5-medium"
        # Tooling cases only, no API key needed.

    python3 scripts/adversarial_stress_test.py --auto-gm \\
        --label "opus5-medium" --model claude-opus-5 --effort medium
        # GM-facing cases only, automatically, via the real API.

    python3 scripts/adversarial_stress_test.py --list-stress-prompts
        # Prints the GM_STRESS_PROMPTS prompts to paste into a live session
        # by hand instead (no API key needed; see mode 1 above).

    python3 scripts/adversarial_stress_test.py --submit-stress-prompt CASE_ID \\
        --label "opus5-medium" --state-file /tmp/drafted_state.json \\
        --narration-file /tmp/drafted_narration.txt
        # Feeds one manually-drafted response through the real pipeline.

    python3 scripts/adversarial_stress_test.py --compare LABEL_A LABEL_B
        # Diffs two completed runs case-by-case.

Only ever run this against a throwaway/test campaign -- same rule as
earn_clean_slate.py, enforced the same way (refuses past turn 0), since
this permanently writes commits and backups for every case that isn't
caught.

Every mode restores saves/current.json, saves/npc_registry.json and
saves/journal.md to the turn-0 baseline between cases and between labels,
so no case is drafted against a previous case's commit and a second
label doesn't hit the turn-0 refusal. Backups under saves/backups/ are
deliberately left in place as the record of what actually ran.
