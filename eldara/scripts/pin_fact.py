"""Add, list or remove an entry in saves/pinned_facts.json -- the small set
of load-bearing facts lore_consistency_check.py hard-checks every turn.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
pinned_facts.json was read by lore_consistency_check.py and written by
nothing. Blind GM runs hit that wall independently at least four times and
stopped each time -- "I tried to add Maren's no-credit terms to
saves/pinned_facts.json ... the write needs your approval", and a later
turn, "that edit wasn't approved last time". The judgement behind those
requests was sound: one run also declined to pin a date, reasoning that no
regex would catch drift on it honestly. Only the mechanism was missing.

WHY IT VALIDATES RATHER THAN JUST WRITING
------------------------------------------
The job here is not writing JSON. It is refusing to write an entry that
disables the checker. lore_consistency_check.py reaches
fact["contradiction_patterns"] directly and calls re.search() on each
pattern unguarded, so a malformed pattern raises re.error and a missing
key raises KeyError -- and commit_state.run_lore_check() swallows failures
by design, because an advisory going quiet must never block a commit. Put
those together and one bad pinned fact makes the entire lore advisory
silently dead: it appears to run and find nothing. That is the worst
failure an advisory can have, and it is why every check below happens
before anything is written.

WHAT A PATTERN MUST SURVIVE
---------------------------
  1. It must compile.
  2. It must actually match the contradiction example given, so a pattern
     that can never fire is rejected at the door rather than sitting in
     the file looking like protection.
  3. It must not match the ESTABLISHED fact's own wording, which would
     make the entry flag itself.
  4. It must finish quickly against a pathological input. User-supplied
     regex is the classic ReDoS surface -- nested quantifiers over
     overlapping classes, (a+)+ and friends -- and this file is edited by
     a model mid-session, not reviewed by a human first.
  5. It is tested against real GM prose harvested from the run
     transcripts in saves/exports/. A pattern that fires on prose nobody
     thought was a contradiction is reported with the offending line
     BEFORE the entry lands. This is the check that cannot be done by
     reasoning about the regex, only by running it against what the GM
     actually writes.

None of this makes a pattern correct -- only survivable. Whether the fact
is worth pinning at all stays a judgement call, and the right answer is
often no: a fact no honest regex can catch should not be pinned, and
saying so is not a failure.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/pin_fact.py --list
    python3 scripts/pin_fact.py --add \\
        --name "Maren's terms" \\
        --fact "Maren will not extend credit; established on-screen turn 12." \\
        --pattern '\\bMaren (?:lets|let) him (?:stay|sleep) (?:for )?free\\b' \\
        --contradiction "Maren lets him stay free for the night." \\
        [--force]
    python3 scripts/pin_fact.py --remove "Maren's terms"
