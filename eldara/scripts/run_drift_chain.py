"""Run a CHAIN of turns against one campaign, each turn a fresh session, and
check mechanically whether the GM rewrote established fact under player
pressure.

WHY THIS EXISTS (and why run_stress_prompts.py could not do it)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Every test in this project before this one was exactly one turn deep,
starting from a fixture. run_stress_prompts.py gives each case its own
fresh campaign copy -- correctly, because a case that commits would
otherwise change the campaign the next case reads. But that isolation
means nothing has ever fed a GM's own turn-N output forward as turn-N+1's
input, and drift is by definition what accumulates across a sequence.
A one-turn test cannot show it no matter how many times it is run.

WHAT THE LITERATURE SAYS TO PROBE
---------------------------------
Two findings shaped this design, and both argue against the obvious test
(a long chain of cooperative turns):

  1. NCP-Bench (arXiv 2608.08160, "Can LLM Agents Stick to the Script?")
     measures Narrative Commitment Preservation over interactive
     narratives and finds the dominant failure is FACT CONFLICT -- 40-68%
     of runs across models, with the best model surviving only 42% of
     20-turn runs. The mechanism they name is "narrative yielding": when
     a player asserts they already possess a key the story established as
     locked away, the model implicitly rewrites history to accommodate
     them. Their detector is a fact ledger updated per turn plus an LLM
     audit pipeline checking each response for fact, commitment and
     player-input conflicts.

  2. The goal-drift work (arXiv 2505.02709) finds that PATTERN-MATCHING
     PRESSURE, not token distance, drives drift. Length alone is not the
     stimulus.

Together those say: a chain of cooperative turns is the wrong experiment.
The failure mode needs a player asserting things the ledger contradicts.
So this chain is pressure-dense rather than long -- four of six turns
assert something the save says is false.

WHERE THIS PROJECT HAS AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE BENCHMARK
-------------------------------------------------------
NCP-Bench needs an LLM audit pipeline to detect fact conflict because its
narrative facts live in prose. Eldara's fact ledger is saves/current.json
-- structured, schema-validated, committed per turn. So the same check is
DETERMINISTIC here: each pressure turn carries a yield_check predicate
over the committed state, and a rewritten fact is a diff, not a judgement.
That is a real methodological gain and the reason this is worth running
rather than just citing.

WHAT IT CANNOT CHECK
--------------------
Whether the GM pushed back WELL -- gracefully, in character, without
lecturing the player -- is prose, and no predicate here reads prose. The
yield checks answer "did the ledger change", not "was the refusal any
good". Read the transcript for the second question; this script only
settles the first.

Also: a yield_check returning False means THAT assertion did not land in
state. It does not mean the turn was correct. The GM could refuse the
lantern and still mangle the date. The per-turn validator output and the
ledger diff are printed for exactly that reason.

CONTAINMENT
-----------
Every chain runs against its own throwaway copy with no git remote. The
live campaign is never the working directory and is never written to.

STATISTICS
----------
Multi-turn runs vary far more than single-turn ones -- single-run pass@1
estimates move 2.2-6.0 points depending on which run you happen to pick,
and small early divergences compound across turns. So --chains defaults
to 3: one run cannot separate drift from sampling noise. Three is the
commonly reported floor, not a comfortable number; treat a 1-of-3 result
as "seen once", not as a rate.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/run_drift_chain.py --label probe            # 3 chains x 6 turns
    python3 scripts/run_drift_chain.py --chains 1 --turns 2     # smoke test first
