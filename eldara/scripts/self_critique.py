"""Heuristic self-critique pass over drafted narration, checking for the
handful of pillar violations that are at least partially mechanically
detectable from the text alone: invented gear/currency words not present
in saves/current.json, and a few other cheap textual signals.

This is NOT a substitute for actual judgment -- it's a narrow, literal
safety net that catches obvious slips (an invented item name, a currency
word appearing outside the currency object's vocabulary) before a human
or a more careful read does. A clean pass here does not mean the turn is
good; a FLAGGED result should always be treated as something to look at.

Coverage notes: the invented-gear check tolerates a bounded amount of
sentence variation around "his X" (an inserted adjective, a nested
possessive like "his grandfather's sword") and phrase-matching normalizes
curly/smart quotes, since both were confirmed gaps in earlier testing.
None of this changes what kind of check this is -- it is still pattern
matching against a finite set of shapes, not comprehension. A sentence
that names an item without a possessive at all ("the sword at his hip",
"the weapon in his hand"), or that refers to an item only descriptively
or by what it does, will still pass the hard FLAGGED/CLEAN check silently.
Closing that class of gap for real would need semantic judgment (e.g. an
LLM call), not another regex -- see docs/MODEL_NOTES.md.

Advisory notices: advisory_gear_mentions() and advisory_structural_notes()
below report on that exact remaining gap -- broader, looser proximity
matching that never blocks a commit (the exit code only reflects the hard
checks above). This is a genuine, deliberate trade: because these notices
can't fail a commit, they can afford to be noisier than the hard checks
without cost beyond an extra line to read. Confirmed in testing: real
false positives do occur (an incoming projectile "grazing his shoulder",
someone else's tool mentioned in the same sentence, a scar described
metaphorically) -- these are the price of surfacing evasions the hard
checks can't catch without becoming unboundedly wide themselves. Read
ADVISORY output as "might be worth a glance," never as a verdict.
