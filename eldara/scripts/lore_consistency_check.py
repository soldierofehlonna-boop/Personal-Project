"""Advisory lore-consistency pass over drafted narration: retrieves the
lore sections relevant to what a turn actually mentions, then surfaces
places where the narration and the retrieved lore might disagree.

This is the retrieval-driven half of self_critique.py's job, not a
replacement for it. self_critique.py checks narration against MECHANICAL
state (saves/current.json) -- gear, currency, tone breaks -- using fixed,
hand-written patterns for a fixed, small vocabulary. That works because
gear/currency are closed, structured sets. World lore is neither: it's
prose, open-ended, and far bigger than anything worth hand-coding a
pattern list for. So instead of pattern-matching lore facts directly,
this script leans on retrieval (scripts/world_info_lookup.py's existing
keyword -> section mapping) to find which lore sections are RELEVANT to
this turn, prints them for a human to actually compare against, and adds
only a small number of cheap, high-confidence textual signals on top
(e.g. a named NPC the lore explicitly marks as dead appearing as if
alive). Everything else is surfaced, not adjudicated -- the same
hard/advisory split self_critique.py already uses, applied to a domain
where the "hard" side has to stay much narrower.

Why this is a separate script rather than added to self_critique.py:
self_critique.py's checks are all synchronous, dependency-free pattern
matches against a small closed vocabulary (CURRENCY_WORDS, a fixed
weapon-word list) -- cheap enough to run on every commit without a
second thought. Lore retrieval pulls in a second file
(world_info_lookup.py), operates over open-ended prose instead of a
closed vocabulary, and is expected to grow (more entity types, better
matching) independently of the gear/currency checks. Keeping it separate
means a change here can't silently alter self_critique.py's existing,
already-tuned behavior, and this script can be skipped in contexts where
world_info_lookup's data isn't available without touching the mandatory
gate at all.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/lore_consistency_check.py <path-to-drafted-turn.txt>

Exit code is always 0 -- this script never blocks a commit (see
commit_state.py's --skip-lore-check docstring for how it's wired in).
Advisory notices go to stdout; a human (or, per docs/MODEL_NOTES.md, a
future LLM-based judge) decides what to do with them.
